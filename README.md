spellingBee
============

Takes a repo URL and performs a spell check on the README file. Upon finding corrections, Dawson's Spelling Bee now forks, edits, and pull requests these spelling suggestions!<br>

Only replace words which have mapped replacements in ```/spellingBee/words.txt```

```words.txt``` was generated from ```http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/For_machines``` 

Next to add to word list is ```http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/APOCAL/Pod-Spell-CommonMistakes-1.000/lib/Pod/Spell/CommonMistakes/WordList.pm```
